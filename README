## Soft Typing 4 PHP

# Introduction

This Experimentation Project (7.5 ECTS) was undertaken as part of my study Software Technology 
at the University of Utrecht in May and June 2011. The goal of the project is to 
statically infer types for every variable in a PHP program and to give suitable warnings 
whenever a program is provably wrong. 

This was realized by specifying the problem as a monotone framework instance and by solving
the instance using a iterative work-list algorithm to find the maximal fixed point solution. 
The theory behind monotone framework is described in Principles of Program Analysis by 
Nielson, Nielson & Hankin. 

During the execution of each transfer function constraints for the PHP expression at hand 
are generated, and the type of an expression is found by resolving these constraints. 
This idea was described by Camphuijsen in Soft typing and analyses on PHP programs 

# Code organization


# Compiling and running 

To compile the program, simply type:

$ make

To analyze the file input.php, simply type:

$ ./run
